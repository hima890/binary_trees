# 0x1D C - Binary Trees :

> This project explores the concepts and implementation of binary trees in C, developed collaboratively with [Ruba Salih](https://github.com/Ruba-Salih/). It covers various operations and properties of binary trees, enhancing understanding of data structures and algorithms.

## Key Concepts Explored:

- Understanding binary trees and their structure.
- Differentiating between binary trees and Binary Search Trees (BST).
- Comparing time complexity gains compared to linked lists.
- Exploring tree properties such as depth, height, and size.
- Implementing different traversal methods for binary trees.
- Recognizing different types of binary trees: complete, full, perfect, and balanced.

## Tasks Completed :heavy_check_mark:

1. Function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
2. Function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
3. Function that deletes an entire binary tree.
4. Function that checks if a node is a leaf.
